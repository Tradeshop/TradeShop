## Description
This plugin manages how players trade one item for another. The concept behind it is very simple, you just place a chest and a sign on top, then write all the information on the sign. A more visually pleasing introduction is offered on the [Overview page on SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/32762/).
