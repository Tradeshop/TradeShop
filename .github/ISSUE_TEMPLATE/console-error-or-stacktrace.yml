        Before reporting an error here, please make sure you are on the latest version of TradeShop (both STABLE or DEV -- check [here](https://github.com/Tradeshop/TradeShop/releases) for DEV builds).
        Forks of TradeShop receive no support here. If you are using a fork, please make sure that this error also happens when using the upstream TradeShop version.
        Please DO NOT use this issue template if you do not see a stacktrace or any other kind of error message. Use a more appropriate issue template instead (when in doubt, ask on [Discord](https://discord.link/TradeShopPlugin)).

        We need all of the stack trace! Do not cut off parts of it no matter how long it is. Please do not use attachments.
        If you prefer, you can use a paste site like https://paste.gg. Please only add more than one stacktrace if you are sure they are releated. Otherwise, open an issue for every stacktrace.

        paste your stack trace or a paste.gg link here!

        Run `/version` and `/ts help` on your server and **paste** the full, unmodified output here.
        "latest" is *not* a version; we require the actual output outputs so we can adequately track down the issue.
        Additionally, do NOT provide a screenshot, you MUST paste the entire output.
        Lastly, if you use a pre-release (DEV build), add the date and time of the release as well, as often many pre-releases share the same version tag.
